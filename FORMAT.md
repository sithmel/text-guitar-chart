# How to represent a fingering using text

2 formats are supported. A concise ascii one that is designed to be edited easily and a nicer one that uses unicode, looks better but is more difficult to edit.

## General rules and semantic
The diagram represent a fragment of a guitar fretboard with low pitch string on the left and high pitch on the right. They are formed by 3 sections:
- title (optional)
- open strings (optional)
- fretboard (mandatory)

### String numbering
Strings are numbered 1-6 from right to left in the diagram. In standard guitar tuning:
- String 6 (leftmost) is the lowest pitch (E2)
- String 1 (rightmost) is the highest pitch (E4)

### Color values
The format supports two colors for fingering markers:
- `#000000` (black) for regular fingering positions
- `#e74c3c` (red/root marker color) for special positions (typically root notes)

Any color value other than `#000000` is treated as a root marker and rendered with the special marker symbol.

## ascii format

### title section
The title (optional) is max 15 characters all on the same line. If this section is included it is separated from the section underneath by a line of "#". The line is as long as the title above, with a minimum of 6 characters.

### open string section
The open string section is optional and separated from the section underneath by "------" or "======". This separator is always included as it is the first line of the fretboard section.
- "------" is used when no fret position is set, or when the fret position is written on the first line of the fretboard section (including position 1)
- "======" is used as an alternate representation when the fret position is 1 (in this case, the position number is not written on the fretboard line)

Note: Position 1 can be represented in two ways:
1. Using "------" with " 1" written on the first fretboard line
2. Using "======" with no position number on the fretboard line

This section contains up to 6 elements (one for each string). Trailing spaces are trimmed from the line. Each position can be:
- " " (space) means that the string at this position is neither muted nor played
- "x" means that the string at this position is muted
- "o" means that the string at this position is played (open string) 

### fretboard section
This section is mandatory and at least 3 rows long (3 frets).
The first line can optionally have an indication of the starting fret on the left, right-justified in a 2-character field (e.g., " 5" for fret 5, "15" for fret 15).

These different characters are used:
- "|" indicates that there is no fingering in this position
- "o" indicates that this position is fingered with a regular dot (color #000000)
- "*" indicates that this position is fingered with a root marker (non-black color, typically #e74c3c)
- any other character is displayed as text on the fretboard at that position (commonly used for finger numbers or note names)

Examples:

```
  A min

  oo   o

## unicode format

### title section
The title (optional) is max 15 characters all on the same line. If this section is included it is separated from the section underneath by a line of "‾". The line is as long as the title above and at least 11 characters

### open string section
The open string section is optional and separated from the section underneath by "┌─┬─┬─┬─┬─┐" or "╒═╤═╤═╤═╕". This separator is always included as it is the first line of the fretboard section.
- "┌─┬─┬─┬─┬─┐" is used when no fret position is set, or when the fret position is written on the second line of the fretboard section (including position 1)
- "╒═╤═╤═╤═╕" is used as an alternate representation when the fret position is 1 (in this case, the position number is not written on the fretboard)

Note: Position 1 can be represented in two ways:
1. Using "┌─┬─┬─┬─┬─┐" with " 1" written on the second line of the fretboard section
2. Using "╒═╤═╤═╤═╕" with no position number on the fretboard

This section contains up to 6 elements (one for each string) separated by spaces. Trailing spaces are trimmed from the line. Each position can be:
- " " (space) means that the string at this position is neither muted nor played
- "×" means that the string at this position is muted
- "○" means that the string at this position is played (open string)

### fretboard section
This section is mandatory and at least 3 frets long. It is built as a grid:
```
  ┌─┬─┬─┬─┬─┐
  │ │ │ │ │ │
  ├─┼─┼─┼─┼─┤
  │ │ │ │ │ │
  ├─┼─┼─┼─┼─┤
  │ │ │ │ │ │
  └─┴─┴─┴─┴─┘
```
The second line can optionally have an indication of the starting fret on the left, right-justified in a 2-character field (e.g., " 5" for fret 5, "15" for fret 15).

The even rows contain characters representing the fingering:
- "│" indicates that there is no fingering in this position
- "○" indicates that this position is fingered with a regular dot (color #000000)
- "●" indicates that this position is fingered with a root marker (non-black color, typically #e74c3c)
- any other character is displayed as text on the fretboard at that position (commonly used for finger numbers or note names)

Example:
```
  A minor
  ‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾

## Edge cases and special behaviors

### Missing sections
- If no title is provided, the title and separator lines are omitted
- If no open strings are defined (no string with fret 0 or "x"), the open string section is omitted
- The fretboard section is always present (minimum 3 frets)

### Empty chords
An empty chord (no fingerings) renders as just the fretboard grid with no markers.
